<B>Notes:</B>
- The Doctor AI emulates the thinking of a doctor. He comes up with a list of the most probable diagnoses based on the patient's reported symptoms. Then he asks a series of questions to narrow down the diagnosis.
- At the moment, the Doctor AI can only diagnose the 6 most common causes of coughs in adults. His knowledge base can be infinitely expanded in the future.
- The accuracy of the diagnosis is limited by the lack of a physical exam, laboratory testing, and diagnostic imaging.
